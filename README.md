# TranslatorApp

Hi there,
this is a GUI translator app with a SQLite file as a database. It's a C# WPF project.

Start the TranslatorApp.exe in the Program folder to run the app.

You can use the Add a word page to add words, their translations and categories. 
Then, there is the Look up a word page to find a word in the database.
Since you can add a category for every word, you are able to find all words belonging to a category on the Look up a category page.

The Settings page allows you to export or import the database as a csv file or to delete it.
The database is empty from the start. You can enter your own words or import the wordsDatabaseBackup.csv file in the Program folder
which contains English words and their German translations.

The source files are also included in a specific folder.
